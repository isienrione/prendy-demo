# 🎉 Prendy — The Logistics OS for Social Connection

> Turn 10 hours of event planning into 10 minutes.

Prendy is a B2B2C platform that automates the multi-sided workflow of organizing real-world gatherings. We take the administrative burden off community initiators so they can focus on what matters: the people.

## 🚀 The Problem

Society has perfected the logistics of isolation. Today, staying home is frictionless while organizing a real-world gathering feels like an inconvenient, exhausting chore. Communities are disappearing because the administrative tax of planning a social life is simply too high.

We call this **Initiator Burnout**: the back-and-forth with venues and vendors, the guest coordination, the decision fatigue, and the mental load of making sure everything works. People aren't staying home because they want to. They stay home because the effort-to-reward ratio of social life is broken.

## 💡 The Solution

Prendy provides **Event Blueprints** — curated journey templates built on traceable algorithms rooted in real human insight that guarantee a high-quality social experience. We are the first to productize "social success" into a scalable algorithm.

We aren't fighting convenience. We're using it to save social connection.

## 🏗️ Platform

The demo showcases three perspectives:

- **Organizer View** — Create events, get auto-generated blueprints, manage guests, track day-of logistics
- **Vendor View** — Receive matched event requests, manage bookings, track revenue
- **Venue View** — Showcase spaces, manage availability, receive qualified demand
